## Takeaways

- **Become a better programmer**: This class will teach you how to be a more independent programmer who can build cool things on your own, like a superhero training camp for coders.
- **Learn about efficiency**: You'll learn how to make your programs run faster and use less memory. The class teaches you about special tools called **algorithms** and **data structures** to organize information efficiently.
- **Solve big challenges**: You'll learn how to design, build, and fix very large programs, which is a different skill than what you might have learned in earlier classes.
- **Why it's important**: The skills you'll learn are used to build things that we use every day, like Google's search and self-driving cars.
- **Practice is key**: The best way to learn is by doing the work yourself. Watching videos isn't enough; you have to practice by doing the labs, homework, and projects.
